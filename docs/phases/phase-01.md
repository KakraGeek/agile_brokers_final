# Phase 1: Project Foundation & Setup

**Phase Goal:** Establish the Next.js project foundation with proper configuration, dependencies, and basic structure.

**Duration:** 1-2 days  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Deliverables:** Working Next.js project with basic configuration

---

## Overview
This phase establishes the foundational Next.js project structure, installs dependencies, and ensures the development environment is properly configured for Windows/PowerShell.

## Key Objectives
- ✅ Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
- ✅ Configure Tailwind CSS and PostCSS
- ✅ Set up proper file structure and routing
- ✅ Ensure static export configuration works
- ✅ Validate development environment

## Technical Requirements
- Node.js 20.x LTS
- npm package manager
- Windows PowerShell compatibility
- Static export enabled (`next export`)
- TypeScript strict mode
- Tailwind CSS with custom theme

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `npm run dev` starts successfully
- [ ] `npm run build` completes without errors
- [ ] `npm run export` generates static files
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] Tailwind CSS classes work in browser
- [ ] Basic routing structure established

## Risk Mitigation
- **Windows Path Issues:** Use forward slashes and cross-env
- **Static Export:** Test export process early
- **Dependencies:** Lock versions in package-lock.json

## Next Phase Dependencies
- Phase 2 requires this foundation to be complete
- All subsequent phases build upon this structure

## Slices in This Phase
1. **Slice A:** Project initialization and dependency installation
2. **Slice B:** Basic Next.js configuration and routing setup
3. **Slice C:** Tailwind CSS integration and theme configuration

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All npm scripts execute successfully
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] Static export generates valid files
- [ ] Development server responds correctly
