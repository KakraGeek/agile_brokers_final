# Phase 4: Motion, Animations & Accessibility

**Phase Goal:** Implement smooth animations and motion effects while ensuring full accessibility compliance and reduced motion support.

**Duration:** 2-3 days  
**Dependencies:** Phase 3 complete  
**Deliverables:** Polished animations with full accessibility compliance

---

## Overview
This phase adds engaging motion effects using Framer Motion, implements transform-based parallax effects, and ensures the site meets WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility standards with proper reduced motion support.

## Key Objectives
- ✅ Implement entrance animations for page content
- ✅ Add transform-based parallax effects (no background-attachment: fixed)
- ✅ Ensure full accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.2 AA)
- ✅ Implement reduced motion preferences support
- ✅ Add focus management and keyboard navigation
- ✅ Create smooth, performant animations

## Technical Requirements
- Framer Motion for animations
- Transform-only parallax (CSS transforms only)
- Reduced motion media query support
- Focus indicators and skip links
- ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Keyboard navigation support

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All animations respect reduced motion preferences
- [ ] Parallax effects use only CSS transforms
- [ ] WCAG 2.2 AA compliance achieved
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works throughout
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible and clear
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility verified

## Animation Features
- **Entrance Animations:** Fade-in and slide-up effects for content
- **Parallax Effects:** Transform-based scrolling animations
- **Interactive Elements:** Hover and focus state animations
- **Page Transitions:** Smooth navigation between pages

## Accessibility Requirements
- **Focus Management:** Clear focus indicators
- **Skip Links:** Jump to main content
- **ARIA Labels:** Proper labeling for interactive elements
- **Semantic HTML:** Proper heading structure and landmarks
- **Color Contrast:** Meet WCAG contrast requirements

## Risk Mitigation
- **Performance:** Ensure animations don't impact Core Web Vitals
- **Accessibility:** Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **Reduced Motion:** Validate reduced motion preferences work correctly

## Next Phase Dependencies
- Phase 5 requires accessibility foundation to be complete
- Contact forms build upon accessibility standards
