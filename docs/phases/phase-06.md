# Phase 6: Deployment & Post-Launch

**Phase Goal:** Deploy the website to production hosting and establish post-launch monitoring and maintenance procedures.

**Duration:** 1-2 days  
**Dependencies:** Phase 5 complete  
**Deliverables:** Live website with monitoring and maintenance procedures

---

## Overview
This final phase focuses on deploying the website to production hosting (cPanel), validating the deployment, and establishing post-launch monitoring and maintenance procedures.

## Key Objectives
- ✅ Build and export static files
- ✅ Deploy to cPanel hosting
- ✅ Validate production deployment
- ✅ Establish monitoring procedures
- ✅ Document deployment process
- ✅ Plan post-launch maintenance

## Technical Requirements
- Static export with `next export`
- cPanel file upload process
- Production environment validation
- Performance monitoring setup
- Error tracking implementation
- Backup and recovery procedures

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Static export completes successfully
- [ ] Files upload to cPanel correctly
- [ ] Website is accessible in production
- [ ] All functionality works in production
- [ ] Performance meets production targets
- [ ] Monitoring is established

## Deployment Process
1. **Build:** `npm run build`
2. **Export:** `npm run export`
3. **Upload:** Transfer `/out` contents to cPanel `public_html/`
4. **Validate:** Test all functionality in production
5. **Monitor:** Establish performance and error monitoring

## cPanel Deployment
- **Target Directory:** `public_html/`
- **File Transfer:** Upload all static files
- **Permissions:** Ensure proper file permissions
- **Testing:** Validate all pages and functionality
- **DNS:** Update domain if necessary

## Post-Launch Monitoring
- **Performance:** Monitor Core Web Vitals
- **Errors:** Track JavaScript errors and issues
- **Analytics:** Set up visitor tracking
- **Uptime:** Monitor site availability
- **Security:** Regular security audits

## Risk Mitigation
- **Deployment Issues:** Test deployment process in staging
- **Performance:** Monitor performance metrics post-launch
- **Errors:** Implement error tracking and alerting

## Maintenance Procedures
- **Regular Updates:** Keep dependencies updated
- **Performance Monitoring:** Regular Lighthouse audits
- **Security Updates:** Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- **Content Updates:** Process for updating content
- **Backup Procedures:** Regular backup and recovery testing
