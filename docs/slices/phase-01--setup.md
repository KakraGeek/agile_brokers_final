# Slice A: Project Initialization & Dependencies

**Phase:** 1  
**Slice:** A  
**Goal:** Initialize Next.js project and install all required dependencies  
**Duration:** 2-4 hours  
**Dependencies:** None  

---

## Overview
This slice establishes the foundational Next.js project structure, installs all required dependencies, and ensures the development environment is properly configured for Windows/PowerShell.

## Tasks

### 1. Project Initialization
- [ ] Verify Node.js 20.x LTS is installed
- [ ] Initialize npm project (package.json already created)
- [ ] Install all dependencies from package.json
- [ ] Verify package-lock.json is generated

### 2. Dependency Installation
```bash
npm install
```

**Expected Dependencies:**
- **Core:** Next.js 14, React 18, React DOM 18
- **UI:** Framer Motion, Lucide React
- **Content:** gray-matter, remark, remark-html
- **Dev:** TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, Autoprefixer

### 3. Environment Setup
- [ ] Copy `env.example` to `.env.local`
- [ ] Verify environment variables are accessible
- [ ] Test cross-env compatibility

### 4. Initial Validation
- [ ] Run `npm run type-check` (should pass)
- [ ] Verify TypeScript configuration is correct
- [ ] Check that all imports resolve correctly

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All dependencies install without errors
- [ ] package-lock.json is generated
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] No missing dependency errors
- [ ] Environment variables are accessible

## Files Modified/Created
- `package-lock.json` (generated)
- `node_modules/` (created)
- `.env.local` (copied from env.example)

## Testing
- **Dependency Check:** `npm ls` shows no missing dependencies
- **TypeScript:** `npm run type-check` completes successfully
- **Environment:** Environment variables are accessible in code

## Next Slice
**Slice B:** Basic Next.js configuration and routing setup

## Notes
- This slice focuses on getting the basic project structure working
- All major dependencies are already defined in package.json
- Focus on ensuring clean installation and no conflicts
- Verify Windows/PowerShell compatibility early
